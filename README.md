LL3 - Animating a character
# Lliurament 3: uncompleted / never submitted
## Descripci√≥n
This project corresponds to Task 3. Like the previous one, it was also carried out using Unity, but in this case, with a 3D scene, as opposed to Task 2. The objective was to include a 3D character, either created by the user or downloaded from platforms such as Mixamo. Subsequently, a series of animations (also downloaded from Mixamo) were applied to the character, and its movements were programmed to function smoothly using a set of scripts. Finally, animation clips were created to handle the transitions between different animations. This project was never fully developed or completed.
